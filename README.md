## duki / dukidokii

i do game dev. mostly with **python** and **lua**.  
currently learning **c#** for **unity** and **roblox studio** stuff.  
projects will eventually show up on [itch.io](https://itch.io/profile/dukidokii) (maybe).

### tools & things
- python / lua / c#
- unity / roblox studio
- blender (jk, only in my nightmares)

### current status
- staring at code editors for 20 minutes straight
- thinking about making things more than actually making them
- trying not to burn out before finishing something

### about me
- username is `dukidokii` basically everywhere (discord, itch, etc.)
- lazy but persistent (jk just lazy)
- not on twitter (shit sucks)

might update this later. might not. (probably not...)
